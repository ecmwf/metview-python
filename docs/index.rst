**Metview** is a meteorological workstation application designed to be a complete working environment
for both the operational and research meteorologist. Its capabilities include powerful data access,
processing and visualisation. It features both a powerful **icon-based user interface** for
interactive work and a **Python** interface for batch processing.

.. note::
   These pages concentrate on the Python interface. The full documentation will appear here over time,
   but for now the rest of the Metview documentation (the user interface and the Macro language) and
   supplemental resources such as training courses and FAQs can be found at
   https://confluence.ecmwf.int/metview.

Metview was developed as part of a cooperation between ECMWF and INPE (Brazilian National Institute for Space Research).
