Retrieves GRIB (:class:`Fieldset`), :class:`Bufr` and :class:`Odb` data from the ECMWF MARS (Meteorological Archival and Retrieval System) archive. Note that in addition to data retrieval, :func:`retrieve` also has post-processing options such as ``grid`` and ``area``, for regridding and sub-area extraction respectively; these use the same interpolation routines as the standard ECMWF MARS client.

It is beyond the scope of this documentation to provide explanation to the MARS Retrieval parameters and in general about MARS.  Instead, it is strongly recommended to consult the `MARS user documentation <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/UDOC/MARS+user+documentation>`_, especially the `MARS keywords documentation <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/UDOC/Keywords+in+MARS+and+Dissemination+requests>`_ to find out details about how to define MARS retrievals.
