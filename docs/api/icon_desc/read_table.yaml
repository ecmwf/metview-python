oneliner: Reads ASCII table data with various formatting and reading
  options allowing a wide variety of ASCII data tables to be parsed.
params:
- data:
    default:
    desc: Object representing an ASCII table file.
    ptype: :class:`Table`, :class:`Geopoints` or :class:`Note`
    values:
- table_filename:
    default:
    desc: Specifies the path to the input table file. This parameter, 
      if set, overrides ``data``.
    ptype: str
    values:
- table_delimiter:
    default: ","
    desc: Specifies the (single) character that separates values
       in the table.
    ptype: str
    values:
- table_combine_delimiters:
    default: 'off'
    desc: If "on", then consecutive delimiters will be considered as one. 
      This is often the case when whitespace is used to separate values
      which are aligned in columns. Note that in this case, it is not
      possible to represent missing values in the table. If "off", then
      a delimiter not surrounded by two data values indicates there
      is a missing value on at least one side of it. See the discussion
      in `ASCII Tables <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/METV/ASCII+Tables>`_
      for more details.
    ptype: str
    values: 'on/off'
- table_header_row:
    default: 1
    desc: Specifies which row of the table file contains the names
      of the columns. This row, if present, should contain the one
      entry for each data column, separated with the same delimiter as
      the data. The first row of the table is number 1. Set this parameter
      to 0 in order to indicate that there is no header row.
    ptype: number
    values: 
- table_data_row_offset:
    default: 1
    desc: Specifies how many rows after the header row the first
       data row appears. Normally this is 1, since data tends to start
      on the row after the column headers. If there is no header row, then
      this number is equivalent to the first data row (e.g. if the data
      starts on row 3, then set this parameter to 3).
    ptype: number
    values:
- table_meta_data_rows:
    default:
    desc: Specifies the rows (if any) which contain meta-data in a form
      which can be parsed by Metview. See ASCII Tables for more details. 
    ptype: list[number]
    values: 
- table_columns:
    default:
    desc: In order to conserve resources, it is possible to choose
      to load only a specified set of data columns. The first column
      is numbered 1.
    ptype: list[number]
    values: 
- table_column_types:
    default:
    desc: If Metview does not correctly determine the data types
      of the columns, this parameter makes it possible to specify the
      data types as a list of type names. Possible
      type names are "number" and "string". If ``table_columns`` is set, only
      that subset of columns should be represented by the list of types.
    ptype: list[str]
    values:
