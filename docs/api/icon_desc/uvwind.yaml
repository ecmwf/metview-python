oneliner: Computes the wind from
  spectral (spherical harmonics) divergence and vorticity GRIB fields.
params:
- data:
    default: 
    desc: Specifies the divergence and vorticity GRIB fields. Must be spectral 
      (spherical harmonics) data. The ecCodes paramId must be 155 for the divergence fields 
      and 138 for the vorticity fields.
