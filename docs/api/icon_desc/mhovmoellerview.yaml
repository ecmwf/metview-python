oneliner: Defines the view for Hovmoeller diagram plots. 
params:
- type:
    default: line_hovm
    desc: |-
        Specifies the type of the Hovmoeller diagram to be produced. Options are:
        
        * "area_hovm": diagram derived from an input rectangular area
        * "line_hovm": diagram derived from an input transect line.
        * "vertical_hovm": diagram derived from an input rectangular area and a set of levels.
    ptype: str
    values: line_hovm/area_hovm/vertical_hovm
- line:
    default: '0/-180/0/180'
    desc: Specifies the coordinates of a transect line along which the Hovmoeller
         diagram is calculated in [lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2] format. Enabled when ``type`` is "line_hovm".
    ptype: list[number]
    values: ''
- area:
    default: '30/-30/-30/30'
    desc: Specifies the coordinates of the area (as [north, west, south, east]) over
      which the Hovmoeller diagram is calculated. Enabled when ``type`` is "area_hovm" or 
      "vertical_hovm".
    ptype: list[number]
    values: ''
- average_direction:
    default: east_west
    desc: Specifies the direction along which the averaging is
      performed. Options are "north_south" and "east_west". For "north_south" the averaging
      is weighted by the cosine of the latitudes.
    ptype: str
    values: east_west/north_south
- time_axis_mode:
    default: user
    desc: |-
        Specifies the direction of the date/time axis. The options are as follows:

        * "user": left/bottom date is taken from ``date_min`` and the right/top date is taken from ``date_max``.
        * "automatic_forwards": date limits are taken from the data and plotted left to right or bottom to top.
        * "automatic_backwards": date limits are taken from the data and plotted right to left or top to bottom. This option has the same effect as "user" with default ``date_min`` and ``date_max``.
    ptype: str
    values: automatic_forwards/automatic_backwards/user
- date_min:
    default: automatic
    desc: Specifies the horizontal date minimum value. Default value "automatic"
      indicates that the minimum value will be taken from the input data.
    ptype: str
    values: ''
- date_max:
    default: automatic
    desc: Specifies the horizontal date maximum value. Default value "automatic"
      indicates that the maximum value will be taken from the input data.
    ptype: str
    values: ''
- bottom_level:
    default: '1015.0'
    desc: Specifies the vertical lower limit value, as a pressure level (hPa) or 
        ECMWF model level.
    ptype: number
    values: ''
- top_level:
    default: '0.01'
    desc: Specifies the vertical upper limit value, as a pressure level (hPa) or 
        ECMWF model level.
    ptype: number
    values: ''
- swap_axes:
    default: 'no'
    desc: By default, the definition of the vertical and horizontal axes of the Hovmoeller
      diagrams follows pre-defined rules. However, if ``swap_axes`` is set to 
      "yes" then the axes will be swapped around.
    ptype: str
    values: no/yes
- resolution:
    default: '1.0'
    desc: Used to interpolate the data onto a regular grid, and applies to both the
      horizontal and vertical axes where appropriate. This parameter is essential
      for creating a Hovmoeller diagram from satellite data.
    ptype: number
    values: ''
- time_axis:
    default: ''
    desc: |-
        Specifies the characteristics of the time-series axis as an :func:`maxis` object to be used in the plotting of the data. The following :func:`maxis` parameters are defined by the application; therefore, users should not change their values directly: ``axis_type`` (set to "date"), ``axis_date_min_value`` and ``axis_date_max_value`` (set according to ``date_min`` and ``date_max``, respectively), and ``axis_orientation``. The ``axis_orientation`` parameter is defined according to the following rules:
                 
        * if ``type`` is "line_hovm", the value is set to "horizontal".
        * if ``type`` is "area_hovm" and `average_direction`` is "east_west", the value is set to "horizontal".
        * if ``type`` is "area_hovm" and ``average_direction`` is "north_south", the value is set to "vertical".
        * if ``type`` is "vertical_hovm", the value is set to "horizontal".
        However, it is possible to change ``axis_orientation`` value from its calculated default by setting ``swap_axes`` to "yes". This option is not available for "vertical_hovm".
    ptype: :func:`maxis`
    values: ''
- geo_axis:
    default: ''
    desc: |-
        Specifies the characteristics of the geographical axis as an :func:`maxis` object to be used in the plotting of the data. The following :func:`maxis` parameters are defined by the application; therefore, users should not change their values directly: ``axis_min_value`` and ``axis_max_value`` (set according to ``line`` or ``area`` ), ``axis_type``, ``axis_tick_label_type`` and ``axis_orientation``. The ``axis_type`` and ``axis_tick_label_type`` parameters are defined according to the following rules:
        
        * if ``type`` is "line_hovm", ``axis_type`` is set to "geoline".
        * if ``type`` is "area_hovm" and ``average_direction`` is "east_west", ``axis_type`` is set to "regular" and "axis_tick_label_type`` to "latitude".
        * if ``type`` is "area_hovm" and ``average_direction`` is "north_south", ``axis_type`` is set to "regular" and ``axis_tick_label_type`` to "longitude".
        Moreover, ``axis_orientation`` parameter is defined according to the following rules:
        
        * if ``type`` is "line_hovm", the value is set to "vertical".
        * if ``type`` is "area_hovm" and ``average_direction`` is "east_west", the value is set to "vertical".
        * if ``type`` is "area_hovm" and ``average_direction`` is "north_south" the value is set to "horizontal"
        However, it is possible to change the ``axis_orientation`` from its calculated default by setting ``swap_axes`` to "yes".
    ptype: :func:`maxis`
    values: ''
- vertical_axis:
    default: ''
    desc: >-
        Specifies the characteristics of the level-series axis to be used in the plotting of the
        data. The following :func:`maxis` parameters are defined by the application; therefore, users should 
        not change their values directly: ``axis_min_value`` and ``axis_max_value`` (set according to
        the input data set), ``axis_type``, ``axis_tick_label_type`` and ``axis_orientation``.
    ptype: :func:`maxis`
    values: ''
- vertical_level_type:
    default: as_in_data
    desc: Specifies if a conversion from model level to pressure level needs to be performed. 
        If it is "pressure" and the input data is specified on ECMWF model levels, the
        Logarithm of Surface Pressure (LNSP) field should be added to the input data. 
    ptype: str
    values: as_in_data/pressure
- vertical_scaling:
    default: linear
    desc: Specifies the type of the vertical axis .
    ptype: str
    values: linear/log
- subpage_clipping:
    default: 'off'
    desc: Clips plot to subpage borders.
    ptype: str
    values: on/off
- subpage_x_position:
    default: '12'
    desc: Specifies the X offset of the plot from the left side of the plot frame
      (any subdivision of the display area). This is expressed as a percentage of
      the X-dimension of the plot frame.
    ptype: number
    values: ''
- subpage_y_position:
    default: '10'
    desc: Specifies the Y offset of the plot from the bottom side of the plot frame
      (any subdivision of the display area). This is expressed as a percentage of
      the Y-dimension of the plot frame.
    ptype: number
    values: ''
- subpage_x_length:
    default: '75'
    desc: Specifies the X length of the plot. This is expressed as a percentage of
      the X-dimension of the plot frame. Hence the sum of this X length plus the X
      offset cannot exceed 100 (it is advised that it does not exceed 95 since you
      need some margin on the right for things like axis or map grid labels).
    ptype: number
    values: ''
- subpage_y_length:
    default: '80'
    desc: Same as ``subpage_x_length`` but for the Y length of the plot.
    ptype: number
    values: ''
