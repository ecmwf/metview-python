summary: Computes the relative humidity from temperature, specific humidity
  and logarithm of surface pressure (LNSP) GRIB data. LNSP is only required
  if the input data is specified on ECMWF model levels. The computations are
  based on a mixed-phase Tetens formula used by IFS for diagnostic purposes
  (see `here <https://www.ecmwf.int/en/elibrary/18714-part-iv-physical-processes>`_ 
  on p116 for details from the latest model cycle (CY45R1, at the
  time of the writing of this documentation).

    desc: Specifies the temperature and specific humidity input GRIB data required for 
      the application. If the input is defined on ECMWF (hybrid/eta) model levels it 
      must contain a Logarithm of Surface Pressure field as well (it must have 
      the ecCodes paramId of 152).
