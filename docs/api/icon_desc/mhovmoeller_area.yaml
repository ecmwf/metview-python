return: :class:`NetCDF`
summary: rst
oneliner: Provides input for Hovmoeller diagrams derived from a geographical area.
params:
- data:
    default: 
    desc: Specifies the GRIB data (:class:`Fieldset`) from which to derive the Hovmeller diagram. 
      ``data`` must specify a time-series of a meteorological variable in a latitude-longitude
      or Gaussian grid. If ``data`` contains more than one parameter and/or level
      :func:`mhovmoeller_area` returns a set of Hovmoeller diagrams. 
    ptype: :class:`Fieldset`
    values:
- area:
    default: '30/-30/-30/30'
    desc: Specifies the coordinates of the area (as [north, west, south, east]) over
      which the Hovmoeller diagram is calculated.
    ptype: list[number]
    values: ''
- average_direction:
    default: east_west
    desc: Specifies the direction along which the averaging is
      performed. Options are "north_south" and "east_west". For "north_south" the averaging
      is weighted by the cosine of the latitudes.
    ptype: str
    values: east_west/north_south
- swap_axes:
    default: 'no'
    desc: By default, the definition of the vertical and horizontal axes of the Hovmoeller
      diagrams follows pre-defined rules. However, if ``swap_axes`` is set to 
      "yes" then the axes will be swapped around.
    ptype: str
    values: no/yes
- resolution:
    default: '1.0'
    desc: Used to interpolate the data onto a regular grid, and applies to both the
      horizontal and vertical axes where appropriate. This parameter is essential
      for creating a Hovmoeller diagram from satellite data.
    ptype: number
    values: ''
