return: :class:`Geopoints`
summary: Converts the first field in GRIB data (:class:`Fieldset`) into :class:`Geopoints`. The result
 is in ASCII format, and is stored as a set of separate points rather than as a grid.
 Note that :func:`grib_to_geo` can only converts GRIB data which is in a supported gridded
 format - for example, data in spherical harmonics cannot be converted. For the 
 reverse computation, see :func:`geo_to_grib`.
oneliner: Converts GRIB data (:class:`Fieldset`) into :class:`Geopoints`.
params:
- data:
    default: ''
    desc: Specifies the GRIB data to be converted. Only the first field will be converted.
      In the user interface any icon containing or returning GRIB data can be used here (e.g.
      a GRIB icon or a MARS Retrieval icon etc).
    ptype: :class:`Fieldset`
    values: ''
- geopoints_format:
    default: traditional
    desc: Specifies which of two geopoints_formats should be used for the output
      - either "traditional" (6 columns including date, time and level) or "xyv" (just
      3 columns - longitude, latitude and value). See `Geopoints <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/METV/Geopoints>`_
      for details of these formats.
    ptype: str
    values: traditional/xyv
- missing_data:
    default: include
    desc: Specifies whether to include points with missing values from the GRIB field in the resulting
      :class:`Geopoints`.
    ptype: str
    values: ignore/include
