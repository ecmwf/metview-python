summary: rst
oneliner: Defines the view for average (zonal or meridional) cross-section plots. 
params: 
- bottom_level:
    default: '1015.0'
    desc: Specifies the lower limit of the average cross section, as a pressure value
       (hPa) or ECMWF model level number (hybrid levels).
    ptype: number
    values: ''
- top_level:
    default: '0.01'
    desc: Specifies the upper limit of the average cross section, as a pressure value
      (hPa) or ECMWF model level number (hybrid levels).
    ptype: number
    values: ''
- vertical_scaling:
    default: linear
    desc: Specifies the type of the vertical axis.
    ptype: str
    values: linear/log
- area:
    default: '90/-180/-90/180'
    desc: Specifies the coordinates of the area (as [north, west, south, east]) over
      which the average cross section is calculated. 
    ptype: list
    values: ''
- direction:
    default: ns
    desc: Specifies the direction along which the averaging is
      performed. Options are "ns" (north-south) and "ew" (east-west). For "ns" the averaging
      is weighted by the cosine of the latitudes.
    ptype: str
    values: ns/ew
- horizontal_axis:
    default: ''
    desc: Specifies the plotting attributes of the horizontal axis. 
    ptype: :func:`maxis`
    values: ''
- vertical_axis:
    default: ''
    desc: Specifies the plotting attributes of the vertical axis.
    ptype: :func:`maxis`
