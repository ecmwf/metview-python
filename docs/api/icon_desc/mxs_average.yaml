summary: rst
oneliner: Derives (and returns) vertical average cross section data.
params:
- data:
    default: ''
    desc: Specifies the GRIB data from which to derive the average view data. The input GRIB
      must specify a multi-level (pressure or model levels) upper air meteorological variable, 
      in a latitude-longitude or Gaussian grid. If the input data is specified in model levels,
      you must include a Logarithm Of Surface Pressure (LNSP) field should you want the vertical axis
      of the plot in pressure levels rather than model levels when visualising the output.
      Note that the input fields should be on the same grid. If more than one time and/or
      forecast step is contained in ``data``, it returns a set of average cross sections in the resulting
      data, but note that currently only the first of these will be plotted with :func:`plot`.
    ptype: str
    values: ''
- area:
    default: '90/-180/-90/180'
    desc: Specifies the coordinates of the area (as [North, West, South, East]) over
      which the averages are calculated. 
    ptype: list[number]
    values: ''
- direction:
    default: ns
    desc: Specifies the direction along which the averaging of the variable is
      performed. Options are "ns" (North-South) and "ew" (East-West). For "ns", the averaging
      is weighted by the cosine of latitude.
    ptype: str
    values: ns/ew
