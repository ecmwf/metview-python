return: :class:`Fieldset`
summary: Retrieves and post-processes GRIB data from ECMWF's MARS archive so that it
  could be used in the Met.3D visualisation system.
oneliner: Retrieves and post-processes GRIB data from ECMWF's MAR archive to be used in Met.3D.
params:
- mode:
    default: fc
    desc: Specifies the main retrieval mode. In "fc" mode the selected steps of a
      given forecast can be used for data generation. If ``mode`` is set to
      "an" a period with a start and end date and constant time-step can be defined.
    ptype: str
    values: 'fc/an'
- product:
    default: hires
    desc: Specifies the type of data to be retrieved from MARS. In "hires\"
      mode the operational deterministic forecast is retrieved. While
      in "ens" mode the operational ENS forecast (both "pf" and "cf"
      members) is used. If ``mode`` is "an" this option is disabled and
      automatically set to "hires".
    ptype: str
    values: hires/ens
- number:
    default: '1/TO/50'
    desc: Specifies the perturbed ensemble members to be retrieved as a list. Enabled
      when ``product`` is set to "ens".
    ptype: number or list[number] or list[str]
    values: ''
- levtype:
    default: pl
    desc: >-
      Specifies the type of vertical levels. The possible values are: "pl" (pressure
      levels) and "ml" (ECMWF model levels).
    ptype: str
    values: pl/ml
- pl_levelist:
    default: 1000/925/850/700/500/400/300
    desc: Specifies the list of pressure levels in hPa when ``levtype`` is "pl".
    ptype: number or list[number] or list[str]
    values: ''
- ml_levelist:
    default: '-10'
    desc: Specifies the list of model levels when ``levtype`` is "ml". If the list
      of model levels is a sole negative number (-N) it means that all the model levels will
      be retrieved from the surface up to level N. Please note that model level numbering
      starts at the topmost atmospheric level (click `here <https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/documentation-and-support/137-model-levels>`_
      for details).
    ptype: number or list[number] or list[str]
    values: ''
- params_2d:
    default: '2t/10u/10v'
    desc: |-
      Specifies the list of surface parameters. Please note that when the following precipitation rate parameters are specified their sum is computed and added as a "tprate" field to the results:

      * Convective rain rate: crr
      * Large scale rain rate: lsrr
      * Convective snowfall rate water equivalent: csfr
      * Large scale snowfall rate water equivalent: lssfr
    ptype: str or list[str]
    values: ''
- params_3d:
    default: 't/q/u/v'
    desc: Specifies the list of upper level parameters. Please note that on model levels "z"
     (geopotential) is not archived in MARS. However, when "z" is specified in ``param_3d``
     it will be automatically computed (the fields needed for the computations will also
     be automatically retrieved). To be able to plot "jet cores" in 3D "z" is needed.
    ptype: str or list[str]
    values: ''
- date:
    default: '-1'
    desc: Specifies the run date of the forecast. Available when ``mode`` is "fc".
      The default value is -1 (i.e. yesterday).
    ptype: number
    values: ''
- time:
    default: '0'
    desc: Specifies the run time of the forecast in hours. Available when ``mode``
      is "fc".
    ptype: number
    values: ''
- step:
    default: '0'
    desc: Specifies the forecast steps in hours. Available when ``mode`` is "fc".
    ptype: number or list[number]
    values: ''
- analysis_start_date:
    default: '-1'
    desc: Specifies the start date of the analysis period. Available when ``mode``
      is "an". The default value is -1 (i.e. yesterday).
    ptype: str
    values: ''
- analysis_start_time:
    default: '0'
    desc: Specifies the start time of the period. Available when ``mode`` is "an".
    ptype: number
    values: ''
- analysis_end_date:
    default: '-1'
    desc: Specifies the end date of the period. Available when ``mode`` is "an".
      The default value is -1 (i.e. yesterday).
    ptype: number
    values: ''
- analysis_end_time:
    default: '0'
    desc: Specifies the end time of the period. Available when ``mode`` is "an".
    ptype: number
    values: ''
- analysis_step:
    default: '6'
    desc: Specifies the timestep of the analysis period in hours. Available when ``mode`` is "an". 
    ptype: number
    values: '6/12'
- area:
    default: '-90/-180/90/180'
    desc: Specifies the area of the output ``grid`` in [South, West, North, East] format.
    ptype: list[number]
    values: ''
- grid:
    default: '1/1'
    desc: Specifies the resolution of the output grid in [dx, dy] format, where
      dx is the grid increment in East-West direction, while dy is the grid
      increment in North-South direction (both in units of degrees).
    ptype: list[number]
    values: ''
- retrieve_group_by_time:
    default: 'on'
    desc: |-
      Specifies how the MARS retrievals should be executed. When it is set to "on" the following happens:

      * forecasts: all steps are retrieved together
      * analyses: times within the same day are retrieved together
      When it is set to "off" each step/time is retrieved separately (in a loop). 
    ptype: str
    values: 'on/off'
