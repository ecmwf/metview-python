summary: rst
oneliner: Generates vertical cross section data.
params:
- data:
    default: ''
    desc: |-
      Specifies the GRIB data (:class:`Fieldset`) from which to derive the cross-section. It must contain multi-level fields, in a latitude-longitude or Gaussian grid. The following vertical coordinates are supported:

      * pressure levels
      * ECMWF model levels (hybrid levels used by the IFS). In this case you must include parameter LNSP (logarithm of surface pressure) should you want the orography and the vertical axis of the plot in pressure levels rather than model levels when visualising the output.
      * general coordinates defined by ``vertical_coordinates``

      If wind arrows are to be plotted, then the input data should include three-dimensional wind data, i.e. the u/v/w wind components should all be present. If more than one time and/or forecast step is contained in ``data``, :func:`mcross_sect` returns a set of cross sections.
