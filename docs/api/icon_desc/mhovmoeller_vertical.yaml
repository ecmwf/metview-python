return: :class:`NetCDF`
summary: rst
oneliner: Provides input for Hovemoeller diagrams derived from
  an input geographical area and a set of levels.
params:
- data:
    default: 
    desc: Specifies the GRIB data (:class:`Fieldset`) from which to derive the Hovmeller diagram. 
      ``data`` must specify a time-series of a meteorological variable in a latitude-longitude
      or Gaussian grid. The GRIB data should contain a set of levels for each parameter. Also, 
      if the input data is specified on ECMWF model levels, you must include the parameter LNSP should
      you want the vertical axis of the plot in pressure levels rather than 
      ECMWF model levels when visualising the output.
    ptype: :class:`Fieldset`
    values:
- area:
    default: '30/-30/-30/30'
    desc: Specifies the coordinates of the area (as [north, west, south, east]) over
      which the Hovmoeller diagram is calculated.
    ptype: list[number]
    values: ''
- vertical_level_type:
   default: as_in_data
   desc: Specifies if a conversion from ECMWF model level to pressure level needs
     to be performed. If it is set to "pressure" and the input data is specified
     on ECMWF model levels, the LNSP field should be added to the input data.
