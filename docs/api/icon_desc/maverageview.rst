Defines the **view** for average (zonal or meridional) cross-section plots from a suitable GRIB data source. It can also take the output of :func:`mxs_average` as an input. In this case, a consistency check is performed between the parameters that are common to both functions.

In addition to the parameters required for the average cross section computation, :func:`maverageview` specifies the axis details as well as the plot positioning in the plot frame of the display window / paper sheet.

For further details on the role and usage of views in the visualisation process, please see `Anaylis Views <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/METV/Analysis+Views>`_.
