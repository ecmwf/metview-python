Each particle will receive the same mass, altogether accounting for the total atmospheric mass. Subsequently, particles can move freely in the atmosphere.
      * "o3_tracer": simulates a stratospheric ozone tracer. This option is similar to fill option, but only particles in the stratosphere (defined by PV < 2 pvu) are released.
