return: :class:`Request`
summary: Allows to specify a geographical location which may coincide
  with a meteorological (WMO) station. It is also equipped with a search facility applicable
  to the ECMWFâ€™s station database. If the location is a meteorological station, you can
  search the database of stations by ``name``, ``ident``, ``wmo_block``, ``position``
  or ``area``.
oneliner: Defines a geographical location which may coincide with a meteorological (WMO) station.
params:
- search_stations_database:
    default: wmo
    desc: Selects the type of station location to be entered. When the value is 
      "wmo" a station can be chosen from Metview's built-in WMO station database.
      If the value is "no" you can set an arbitrary location.
    ptype: str
    values: wmo/no
- search_key:
    default: name
    desc: Specifies which parameter should be used in the search of the WMO stations database.
      Only available when ``search_stations_database`` is "wmo".
    ptype: str
    values: name/ident/wmo_block/position/area
- name:
    default: heathrow
    desc:  
      Specifies the location name. If ``search_stations_database`` is set to "no" you are dealing
      with an arbitrary location and you may enter any name of your choice. If
      ``search_stations_database`` is set to "wmo" this should be the name of the required
      station. You need the exact name of the station so you should be careful with the spelling
      which is in accordance to WMO. This tries to match the original language spelling, hence
      an English speaking user should not look for Copenhagen, but rather Kobenhavn. 
    ptype: str or list[str]
    values: ''
- position:
    default: '51.38/-0.78'
    desc: Specifies the exact geographical coordinates (as [lat, lon]) of the location of interest.
      If ``search_stations_database`` is set to "no" you specify the coordinates 
      of an arbitrary location, while if it is set to "wmo" you specify the 
      location of a meteorological station. It may happen that you do not know the exact
      coordinates of the station. In this case, you can specify a geographical tolerance 
      in ``threshold``.
    ptype: number or list[number]
    values: ''
- height:
    default: '0'
    desc: Specifies the height of the station. If ``search_stations_database``
      is set to "no" you can specify the ``height`` here, otherwise
      the station's height is retrieved automatically from the database.
    ptype: number
    values: ''
- threshold:
    default: '0.1'
    desc: Specifies a geographical tolerance in degrees for the coordinates of a
      meteorological station specified in ``position``. This is only available when
      ``search_stations_database`` is "wmo" and ``search_key`` is "position".
    ptype: number
    values: ''
- ident:
    default: '03772'
    desc: Specifies the station's WMO numerical identifier which is a 5
      digit number. If you are in doubt about the identifier, use the assist
      button. This is a station assist button and it launches the Stations database
      search tool. Only available if ``search_stations_database`` is "wmo" and
     ``search_key`` is "ident".
    ptype: number
    values: ''
- wmo_block:
    default: '03'
    desc: Specifies the station's WMO block which is a 2 digit number corresponding
      to a geographical area. If you are in doubt about the WMO block, use
      the assist button. This is a station assist button and it launches the Stations
      database search tool. Only available if ``search_stations_database`` is "wmo"
      and ``search_key`` is "wmo_block".
    ptype: number
    values: ''
- area:
    default: '52/-1/51/0'
    desc: Specifies the coordinates of an area (as [north, west, south, east]) where
      meteorological stations of interest are located. Only available
      if ``search_stations_database`` is "wmo" and ``search_key`` is "area".
    ptype: list[number]
    values: ''
- fail_on_error:
    default: 'yes'
    desc: ''
    ptype: str
    values: yes/no
