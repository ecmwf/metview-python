unipressure
=============

.. py:function:: unipressure(lnsp, [levels], [lnsp_code])
.. py:function:: unipressure(lnsp, fs_levels, [lnsp_code])
   :noindex:

   Computes the pressure (in Pa) on a list of ECMWF model levels from ``lnsp`` (logarithm of surface pressure). 

   :param lnsp: lnsp fieldset
   :type lnsp: :class:`Fieldset`
   :param fs_levels: levels fieldset
   :type fs_levels: :class:`Fieldset`
   :param lnsp_code: ecCodes paramId for lnsp
   :type lnsp_code: number
   :param levels: list of target model levels to compute the pressure on
   :type levels: list
   :rtype: :class:`Fieldset`

   ``lnsp`` must contain an lnsp field, which is identified by its ecCodes paramId. By default the value of 152 is used but it can be overriden by the optional ``lnsp_code``.
   
   The list of target model levels to compute the pressure on depends on the actual arguments:

   * if no ``fs_levels`` is specified the pressure is computed on the full model level range defined by the GRIB header of ``lnsp``.   
   * if ``fs_levels`` is specified the pressure is computed on all the model levels in ``fs_levels``.
   * if ``levels`` is specified it defines the list of target model levels the pressure will be computed on. 
         
   A missing value in ``lnsp`` will result in a missing value in the corresponding place in the output fieldset.
