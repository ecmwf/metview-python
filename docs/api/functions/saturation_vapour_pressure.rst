saturation_vapour_pressure
=============================

..  py:function:: saturation_vapour_pressure(t, [phase])

    Computes the saturation vapour pressure for a given temperature (``t``) and ``phase``.
    
    :param t: temperature (K)
    :type t: number or ndarray
    :param phase: is either "water", "ice" or "mixed". When it is not specified the "water" phase is used.
    :type phase: str
    :rtype: same type as ``t`` or None

    The result is the saturation vapour pressure in Pa units. On error None is returned. The computations for saturation over "water" and "ice" are based on the Tetens formula:

    .. math:: 

        e_{sat} = a_{1}\;exp \left(a_{3}\frac{T-273.16}{T-a_{4}}\right)

    where the parameters are set as follows:

    * "water": a\ :sub:`1` =611.21 Pa, a\ :sub:`3` =17.502 and a\ :sub:`4` =32.19 K
    * "ice": a\ :sub:`1` =611.21 Pa, a\ :sub:`3` =22.587 and a\ :sub:`4` =-0.7 K

    For the "mixed" phase the linear combination of the "water" and "ice" phases are used as described in the IFS documentation (see here on p116 for details for model cycle CY45R1).
